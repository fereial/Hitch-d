# Hitch-d
First VFS project 

This project is game I made in a team of 4 as part of the Vancover Film School for the promgram "Programming for Games Web and Mobile".

Hitch’d: Is a 2.5D vertical platformer where the player plays as a fisherwoman toy trying to catch the last fish in the playground. 
The player uses a hookshot to move around the level to get to the top of them selfs. 

I did the following gameplay elements
  - Developed hookshot gameplay mechanic.
  - Created a system to rotate the hookshoot pointer around the player.
  - Implemented a raycast system that checked for collision to release the player in the middle of travel.
  - Designed a panning camera movement to help the player see the character.
